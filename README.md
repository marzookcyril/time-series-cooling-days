## Introduction

This R script is a time series analysis project that focuses on the temperature data in the United States from the year 2000 to 2020. The dataset, named `data_climat.csv`, is imported and analyzed using various time series analysis techniques.

## Libraries Used

- `forecast`: A library for forecasting time series data.
- `xlsx`: A library for reading and writing Excel files.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset named `data_climat.csv` for the time series analysis. This dataset contains temperature values over the specified time period.

## Usage

- Ensure you have R installed on your machine.
- Install the required librariesv:

install.packages("forecast")
install.packages("xlsx")

- Run the R script using your preferred R environment or command line.

## Important Notes

The script assumes the dataset is in the file named data_climat.csv.
Adjust the time period and other parameters in the code as needed.
This project is for educational purposes and can be extended for more in-depth analysis.
